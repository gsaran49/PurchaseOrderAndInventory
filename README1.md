ABSTRACT
The objective of the project is to develop the software for  Purchase and Inventory System for a departmental store. In the existing software, it is used for maintaining the raw materials bought from the dealers and recording the items sold in the departmental store. In most of the departmental store “tally ERP” is used, and it is proprietary. The proposed system is developed using “open ERP” where it is an open source so that the vendor could be beneficial.
There is no method for giving request to the dealers when the stock is below par. In our software, it will automatically sends the request to the dealer, so that they will a receive a notification about the needed inventory, there is no need to check it manually whether the item is available or not. And also there is no method for storing the profit of the item in the database that are sold. In this software the vendor can check for his profit of the inventory.
